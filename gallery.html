	<p>Here I will show you some of the projects I have been working on since the end of January. There are two Adobe image projects, both of which were worked on in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, respectively. You will also find a collection of photos I have taken from my personal album.</p>

<p> Title:  Aaron Rebaza Selfie
Semester/Year: Spring 2020
Software: Adobe Photoshop 2020
<br>
Description: The images seen here were used in the making of my final Photoshop Project. This look was inspired by the idea of the poster style art that has been seen throughout the internet. This poster style almost gives a sense of importance to whatever subject is placed in it. </p>

<p> Title: Aaron Rebaza Selfie Vector
Semester/Year: Spring 2020
Software: Adobe Photoshop 2020
<br>
 Description: This picture I used of myself was one I took in front of a small tile wall in Queens. The reason I used this picture was that I loved the pattern on the wall. In order to attain the final image results I had opened and scaled the jpeg image to fit my preset 1200px by 1200px. After doing this I used the color presets in image trace > make. Using the 16 colors preset made it pop and created more contrast. The shading on the hat was too dark and I went back and utilized the pen tool to create anchor points to fill in those areas with a lighter shade.</p>
